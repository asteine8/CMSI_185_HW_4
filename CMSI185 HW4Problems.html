         < ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
         <h2>General Details</h2>
         <h4>Due Date: December 7, 2017 [2017-12-07, Thursday of week 15]</h4>
         <p>The following guidelines are expected for all homework submissions:</p>
         <ul><li>All homework must be typed.  Homework which is not typed will be returned ungraded and will be
                 subject to the late homework guidelines as set out on the syllabus page.  PLEASE DO NOT scribble
                 something on lined paper and rip it out of your spiral notebook &mdash; hanging chads went out
                 with the presidential election in 2000.</li>
             <li>I don't care too much about what font you use or how large your margins are; however, you might
                 want to check out a monospaced font for typing code, as it will be easy to see the indentations.</li>
             <li>Speaking of indenting, PLEASE DON'T USE TABS TO INDENT YOUR CODE.  Tabs can often get interpreted
                 differently by different computers and applications, and could make code that is nicely formatted
                 on your computer look &quot;all over the map&quot; on my computer or printer.  USE SPACES INSTEAD.
                 You can set up almost every modern text editor to insert spaces whenever you press the TAB key, or
                 you can simply pound the spacebar.</li>
             <li>Work with a partner.  This mimics an industry code development model called &quot;pair programming&quot;
                 which is part of the Extreme Programming software development method.  Feel free to collaborate in
                 your pairs as much as you want, preferably doing the entire assignment together.</li>
             <li>DO NOT share your work between groups.  Doing so will count as plagiarism.  If you wish to discuss
                 solutions with another group over coffee in the Lair, that's fine as long as it is kept at the
                 conceptual level, but each group needs to turn in its own version of the solutions.</li>
             <li>You only need to turn in one copy per group.</li>
             <li>If you'd like to use the <a href='http://jsfiddle.net/'>jsfiddle</a> website to do your programs,
                 that is great.  Simply save the program in jsfiddle as a shared fiddle, then copy and embed a link
                 to the fiddle into your homework where the answer goes for that problem.  I'll use the link to go
                 to YOUR fiddle and run the code.  To save your fiddles you'll need to sign up for an account&hellip;</li>

            <li class='spacedlist'><span class='underline'>Ch   4,  #22</span>: Explain, in your own words, <em>as
                precisely as possible</em>the behavior of this script:
                <blockquote><pre>
      var i = 0;

                the prime number-testing script is as follows:<br/>
                <ul><li>If <code>n</code> is divisible by 2, you know immediately that <code>n</code> is composite</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, test the divisors 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, &hellip;, to the square root of <code>n</code></li>
                </ul>
                Why does this work?  Rewrite the script to use this improved algorithm.</li>
            <li class='spacedlist'><span class='underline'>pg 126,  #1 </span>: Write a <code>for</code> statement
                that alerts 10, then alerts 9, and so on, until a final alert of 0.</li>
            <li class='spacedlist'><span class='underline'>pg 126,  #2 </span>: Write a little script that computes
                the value of the product of the integers 1 through 20 (inclusive).  Use a <code>for</code>
                statement.</li>
            <li class='spacedlist'><span class='underline'>pg 126,  #3 </span>: What would happen if, in Figure
                4.6, the value of the last object's <code>next</code> property were not <code>null</code> but
                rather a reference to the first object in the chain?</li>
            <li class='spacedlist'><span class='underline'>pg 126,  #4 </span>: In the multiplication table script,
                the inner loop uses the variable <code>j</code> to iterate through the columns.  What would the
                script have produced if the programmer had accidentally used the variable <code>i</code> for both
                the outer and inner loop indices?  [Hint: be careful about array bounds.]</li>

                average of all of the items in an array.  For example, <code>average( [4, 5, 7, 2] )</code> should
                return 4.5.</li>
            <li class='spacedlist'><span class='underline'>Ch   5,  #5 </span>: Write a function that accepts two

                number of occurrences of a given character in a string.  For example, given the string
                <code>&quot;Rat-a-tat-tat&quot;</code> and the character <code>&quot;t&quot;</code>, your function
                should return <code>5</code>.</li>
            <li class='spacedlist'><span class='underline'>Ch   5,  #10</span>: Use the Wolfram Alpha decision
                engine (<a hrep=''>http://www.wolframalpha.com/</a>) to determine why the original
                <code>balanceAfter</code> function from this chapter gives troublesome results for negative numbers
                of compounding periods.  Ask Wolfram Alpha to graph the function
                <code>1000 * (1 + 0.05/n)<sup>10<code>n</code></sup></code> and explain what you are seeing for negative

                Open the web page and, before clicking on various elements, predict the sequence of
                <code>alert</code> messages that you will see.  Open the same page and click around using different
                web browsers as well, and determine which browsers have similar or different event behavior.  [Hint:

         <blockquote>
         <p>These programming problems are designed to give you practice at creating <strong>algorithmic solutions
            to some straightforward problems</strong>.  The intent is not to overload you with tons of homework;
            rather, it is to help you practice the concepts you have learned in class about breaking the problem
            down into parts, figuring out the algorithm for each part, writing the whole thing down, doing a desk
            check, and coding it up and testing it with various inputs.  To that end, You may select any two of
            these three problems.  If you would like to do all three, feel free to do so, of course.  I'll give
            you one extra credit point for your correct solution.</p>
         </blockquote>
         <p><span class='underline'>Exercise 1</span>: Expand the tic-tac-toe game from your text book to do
            a four-by-four game instead of three-by-three.  (Note: this sounds a lot harder than it is...)  The code
            begins on page 254 of your book.</p>
         <p><span class='underline'>Exercise 2 [part one of two parts]</span>:Ch   7,  #22: Write a function that
            takes in a string and returns the reversal of the string.  For example:</p>
            <blockquote><pre>
      reversal( "" )          // returns ""  (the empty string)
      reversal( "a" )         // returns "a"
      reversal( "string" )    // returns "gnirts"
            </pre></blockquote>
         <p><span class='underline'>Exercise 2 [part two of two parts]</span>Ch   7,  #23: Next, build a web interface
            to the string reversal function.  Your web page should have a single input box and a button labeled
            <code>Reverse</code>.  Clicking the button should cause the text in the input box to be replaced with the
            reverse of its current contents.  (Bonus: see how few lines of code you can use to accomplish this task.)</p>
         <p><span class='underline'>Exercise 3</span>: Given a total monetary amount and set of coin denominations,
            determine the smallest number of coins required to make the total amount.  For example, given the total
            amount of $1.23 and the denominations 50, 25, 10, 5, and 1, the answer should be two-50, two-10 and
            three-one coins.  If some denomination is provided which is unusable, such as a negative value, the
            program should simply say "IMPOSSIBLE" for that denomination.  The program should be contained in a
            web page, in which the user inputs an arbitrary amount of money (expressed as a non-negative, whole
            number of cents) in one text box, followed by a sequence of coin denominations (distinct positive
            integers) in the second text box.  The page must then display in its footer area the optimal way of
            making change for the given amount using the given set of denominations.  If there is no way to make
            the change, the program must output the message <code>IMPOSSIBLE</code>.</p>

         <h2>Python Programming Problems</h2>
         <p>The following problems are from the book "Python for Everyone" by Cay Horstmann and Rance D. Necaise,

         <p><span class='underline'>Exercise 4</span>: (PYTHON PROGRAMMING &mdash; text exsample 3.2, page 131)
            Two circles may intersect at a single point, at two points, or at an unlimited number of points when
            the two circles are coincident (on top of each other).  If the circles do NOT intersect, one circle may
            be contained entirely within the other, or they may be completely separate.  Your task is to write a
            program in Python that obtains the parameters for two circles and reports whether they intersect.  For
            each circle, the inputs should be the X and Y coordinate (on a Cartesian grid) of the center, and the
            radius of the circle.  The output should be one and only one of the possible configurations listed
            above, as well as the distance between the two center points.  (Hint: the distance can be determined
            by using the Pythagorean Theorem.)</p>

            to the diner's satisfaction as follows:
            <ul><li>Ask for the diner's satisfaction level using values 1 (satisfied) to 3 (dissatisfied)</li>
                <li>If the diner is totally satisfied (value 1), calculate a 20 percent tip</li>
                <li>If the diner is satisfied (value 2), calculate a 15 percent tip</li>
                <li>If the diner is totally dissatisfied (value 3), calculate a 10 percent tip</li>
                <li>Report the satisfaction level, in words, and the tip, in dollars and cents</li>
